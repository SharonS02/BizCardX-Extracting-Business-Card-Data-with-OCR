# BizCardX-Extracting-Business-Card-Data-with-OCR
BizCardX-Extracting Business Card Data with OCR Bizcard Extraction is a Python application built with Streamlit, EasyOCR,BytesIO, regex function and mysql database.
# EasyOCR
EasyOCR, is a Python package that allows computer vision developers to effortlessly perform Optical Character Recognition. It is a font-dependent printed character reader based on a template matching algorithm. It has been designed to read any kind of short text part numbers, serial numbers, expiry dates, manufacturing dates, lot codes, printed on labels or directly on parts. EasyOCR currently supports 80+ languages. We need to tell EasyOCR which language we want to read. EasyOCR can read multiple languages at the same time but they have to be compatible with each other.

Results:

The result of the project would be a Streamlit application that allows users to upload an image of a business card and extract relevant information from it using easyOCR. The extracted information would include the company name, card holder name, designation, mobile number, email address, website URL, area, city, state, and pin code.

The extracted information would then be displayed in the application's graphical user interface (GUI).

The application would also allow users to save the extracted information into a database along with the uploaded business card image. The database would be able to store multiple entries, each with its own business card image and extracted information.

The final application would have a simple and intuitive user interface that guides users through the process of uploading the business card image and extracting its information. The extracted information would be displayed in a clean and organized manner, and users would be able to easily add it to the database with the click of a button.

The project would require skills in image processing, OCR, GUI development, and database management. It would also require careful design and planning of the application architecture to ensure that it is scalable, maintainable, and extensible. Good documentation and code organization would also be important for the project. Overall, the result of the project would be a useful tool for businesses and individuals who need to manage business card information efficiently.
